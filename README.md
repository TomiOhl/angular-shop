## Development history

- spring 2022: Programrendszerek fejleszt√©se course at SZTE
- beginning of May, 2022: planning the overall features
- 2 days before deadline: quick review of the course
- 1 day before deadline: firebase auth, login, basic store component (list of items)
- the final day: store component, details component with a comments section, buy feature, admin panel, designing everything and deploying to firebase

Since I left this for the last minute the amount of time was the biggest obstacle. I did what I could. Another big barrier was the fact that it's not trivial to get a firebase document's auto-generated ID based on it's contents, and also that where clauses didn't want to work at first.
